        <p class="text-gray-300 mt-3">8 players joined. £10 buy-in each + rebuys. The final prize pot was £150</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mt-3">Two new faces as Mark and Dean made their first apperance. Hand of the game was a double knockout from Ben who was all in pre flop with queen-9 of Diamonds. Triggers hand was sunk and he was very tilted</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300">Final two places were Jack and James, who agreed to a 60-40 split and to play for the remaining 50, with Jack taking the extra 10 due to having double the chips.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300">Winner: <strong>Jack</strong> – Defeated James heads-up after calling a bold bluff with pocket tens on a flop of 5♠️ 5♣️ 4♠️. The board did not improve James hand who was bluffing with 8♥️ 6♠️</p>
